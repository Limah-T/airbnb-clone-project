## 🔐 API Security

Security is a critical aspect of this project to ensure that user data, financial transactions, and system integrity are protected. The following measures are implemented across the backend to secure the APIs:

### ✅ Authentication
**Implementation:** Token-based authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or Django Token Authentication.  
**Purpose:** Ensures that only registered users can access protected endpoints. Prevents unauthorized access to user profiles, bookings, and other sensitive operations.

### ✅ Authorization
**Implementation:** Role-based access control (RBAC).  
**Purpose:** Restricts access to specific resources based on user roles (e.g., admin, host, guest). This prevents users from accessing or modifying resources they don't own or aren't permitted to interact with.

### ✅ Input Validation & Sanitization
**Implementation:** All incoming data is validated using serializers and forms.  
**Purpose:** Prevents injection attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and ensures the integrity of the data stored in the system.

### ✅ Rate Limiting & Throttling
**Implementation:** DRF's throttling mechanism.  
**Purpose:** Protects the API from brute-force attacks and abuse by limiting the number of requests per user/IP over time.

### ✅ HTTPS Enforcement
**Implementation:** SSL/TLS certificates in production.  
**Purpose:** Encrypts all data transmitted between the client and server, protecting against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

### ✅ Secure Payment Handling
**Implementation:** Payment processing is handled through secure third-party services.  
**Purpose:** Ensures that financial data is not stored directly in our system, reducing risk and complying with PCI-DSS guidelines.

### ✅ CORS Configuration
**Implementation:** CORS headers are configured to allow only trusted frontend origins.  
**Purpose:** Prevents malicious websites from interacting with the API via cross-origin requests.

### 🛡️ Why API Security Matters

- **User Data Protection:** Personal data like names, contact details, and payment information must be protected to maintain trust and comply with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).
- **Booking and Payment Integrity:** Securing booking endpoints ensures that transactions are valid, non-repudiable, and not duplicated or forged.
- **System Stability:** Rate limiting and proper error handling ensure the platform remains reliable and is not overwhelmed by malicious or accidental overuse.
- **Preventing Unauthorized Access:** Ensures only legitimate users interact with their own data or roles, especially important in multi-role systems like hosts and guests.

Security is not a one-time setup but an ongoing priority. We regularly update dependencies, monitor for vulnerabilities, and apply best practices throughout development and deployment.

## 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline

### 🧠 What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment** (or Delivery). It is a development practice that enables teams to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably by automating the stages of software delivery.

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automatically builds and tests code whenever changes are pushed to the repository. This ensures that new code integrates smoothly with the existing codebase.
- **Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD):** Automatically deploys code to staging or production environments once it passes tests, reducing manual intervention and speeding up release cycles.

### 🚀 Importance of CI/CD in This Project

- **Faster Development:** Automates testing and deployment, saving time and effort.
- **Improved Code Quality:** Ensures that all code passes tests before being merged or deployed.
- **Early Bug Detection:** CI checks catch bugs early in the development cycle.
- **Reliable Deployments:** CD pipelines ensure consistent and error-free deployment of updates to the application.
- **Team Collaboration:** Developers can work in parallel without worrying about breaking the main application.

### 🛠️ Tools Used

- **GitHub Actions:** Automates the workflow for running tests, linting, and deploying the application on code push or pull requests.
- **Docker:** Ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments using containerized applications.
- **Docker Compose:** Used to define and manage multi-container services (e.g., Django + PostgreSQL + Redis).
- **Heroku / Render / Railway (optional):** For automatic deployment to cloud hosting platforms.
- **pytest / unittest:** For running automated tests during the CI process.
- **Black / flake8:** For code formatting and linting checks in CI.

With CI/CD in place, we ensure our Airbnb Clone backend remains robust, secure, and always production-ready.
